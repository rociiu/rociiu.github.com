Finally setup a blog based by Jekyll, will write some posts soon.

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll][] is a static site generator written in Ruby by Tom
Preston-Werner(of [GitHub][] fame). You create a set of templates and
then just write your posts in plain text using your
markup of choice(I use [Markdown][]). Jekyll then transforms everything
into static HTML that can be served by pretty much anything you like.
